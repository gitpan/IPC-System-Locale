     use IPC::System::Locale qw(system);

DESCRIPTION

FUNCTIONS

 system([ \%opts ], @args)

    This is a shortcut for <IPC::System::Options::system({lang="C"}, ...)>>
    (you can also set lang or other options explicitly).

    This routine might be helpful if you are checking the output of some
    program and want to make sure that the output is in English/C locale.
